# Dvd-Logo-V2.0 (Works on Linux!!! (Only tested on ubuntu and debian) )
The updated repository of my first ever project in python using pygame. This script emulates the classic DVD-logo screensaver of any dvd player back in the early days.

This software is free and unlicensed but i would still like it and it would be kind of you if you put some credit of me the creator When you distribute the software to the internet, like making a video about it. I will be happy when you put either the link to my github or my project in the description or put "Made by: 309Electronics" in the description. I am just a hobbyist and would like to get a bit more attention from the general public so if you could, please credit me, it would help me a lot and would make my motivation not fade away. 

About The Creator 309Electronics: 309Electronics is a self educated electronics enthuisiast, thinkerer, engineer, reverse engineer, programmer, repair guy and project creator. I live in the Netherlands in Eindhoven in a small village called 'acht' I am a highschool student Who likes electronics and coding. i am pretty proud of my work! Please dont expect amazing quality or criticise some things i do or neat code because my motto is "If it works dont touch it" and i am just a hobbyist and not a profesional. Although i am open for any improvements or tips if you can provide them feel free to do so, i like to learn new ways and things. If there are any problems, bugs or you can provide tips please email me to 309Projectscustomerline@gmail.com (long email adres, i know!). Please know that apart from coding and doing the things i like, i also am still a student and have school 5 days in the week + homework to do so i might not always check the customer line/have time to do so. Please be patient and i will always react with a thank you mail or a "got it". I hope you like this project and feel free to scroll through my github page full of (dumb) projects. :)

How to use? 
To use this project follow the below instructions, have fun! 

(Disclaimer: I wrote most of my projects using the vscode ide on Windows and not all things might work on linux or any other os. If i put "Works on linux" or "tested on linux" it works on both platforms.)

Windows:
1. Download python from python.org and use the installer to install it onto your system. (if already installed skip to step 2)
2. Install pip by following the instructions on this page: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ (if pip is installed continue to step 3)
3. install the required modules by executing the "Install.bat" batch file which will read requirements.txt file which contains the modules and uses pip to install it.
4. Execute the Main.py file 
5. Have fun!

Linux:
1. First open a terminal in the directory where the Main.py script is located 
2. In the terminal put in the command "./Install.sh" or "bash Install.sh" to run the installer script.
3. Put in your password when asked to give the installer permission to install and copy over packages onto your system. Just wait till its finished!
4. execute in the same terminal "python3 Main.py" to run the project
5. Have fun!
